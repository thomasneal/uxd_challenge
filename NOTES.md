# Candidate notes

I had a blast creating this component! I thought it was going to go fast because it's not even a full page build, but I ended up spending a lot of time on it because I kept thinking of ways to improve it.

A few things I wanted to explain:

- I debated about minifying the CSS or not, but I decided to do it since it is a best practice. Please review styles.scss.

- I wanted to organize the code like a component, so I have a lot of classes in there. The names are a bit long, but I used BEM here because I think that works well with component design.

- I went with flexbox for this to keep things simple.

- I did make it responsive, so please take a look! (That should always be a requirement, in my opinion.)

- For this project, I supported back to IE 10. There are a couple of IE specific styles to gracefully degrade.

I would love to receive feedback on this. Thanks for taking the time to look at my code!
